A Weather App using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS allows users to view real-time weather
details for a specific city by integrating with a weather API like OpenWeatherMap. The app features a 
simple interface with a search bar for entering city names and dynamically displays weather data such as temperature,
conditions, humidity, and wind speed using JavaScript to fetch and manipulate the API response. 

HTML provides the app's structure, CSS styles it for an appealing look, and JavaScript handles functionality,
including API calls, error handling (e.g., invalid cities), and dynamic content updates. This project demonstrates 
API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
